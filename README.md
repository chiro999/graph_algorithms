# Exploring graphs, traversal and other algorithms

## Breath First Search:
The Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm is used to search a graph data structure for a node that meets a set of criteria. It starts at the root of the graph and visits all nodes at the current depth level before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.
Data Structure Used: Queue

## Depth First Search:
Depth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
Data Structure Used: (Stack)

## Greedy Algorithms
A greedy algorithm is any algorithm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage. Edger Dijkstra, a computer scientist and mathematician who wanted to calculate a minimum spanning tree, introduced the term "Greedy algorithm". Prim and Kruskal came up with optimization techniques for minimizing cost of graphs.
